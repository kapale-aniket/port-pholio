# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using React.  
I created this project to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a software developer.

The website is fully responsive and designed to be simple, clean, and easy to navigate.

## Why I built this
I wanted a single place where recruiters can quickly see:

- How I structure frontend code
- My contact information

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies
